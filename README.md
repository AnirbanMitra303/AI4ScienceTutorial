# AI_science

This tutorial is aimed at students who are interested in learning about Machine Learning techniques. The tutorial relies on IPyhton Notebooks which are targeted for running on [Google's Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com). This platform gives the user a virtual machine in which to run python codes including machine learning codes.

# Before You Arrive

Do the following before you come to the tutorial:
*  You need a Google Account to use Colaboratory
*  Goto [Google's Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com) 
*  You should see this page
![start_page](README_imgs/colab_start_page.png)
*  Click on the `New Python 3 Notebook` at it may say `Python 2` but just click the drop down arrow and select the `Python 3` option.
*  Now you will see a new notebook where you can type in python code.

*  After you enter code, type `shift+enter` to execute the code cell.
*  A full introduction to the notebook environment is out of scope for this tutorial, but many can be found with a [simple google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=jupyter+notebook+tutorial)
*  We will be using notebooks from this repository during the tutorial, so  you should be familiar with how to import them into Colaboratory
